#The biolink model defines the semantics of the elements in our database, and because it is very general, it can
# be used in a variety of contexts.  However, we may want extra constraints on which parts of the model are used
# and which are not.  This yaml file describes the particular set of types that will get into our neo4j, and the
# relationships between them.
# Differences between this and biolink-model:
# 1. There are many elements in the biolink-model hierarchy that we are not interested in attaching as labels at this
#    time.  For instance, between named_thing and  gene_or_gene_product are "biological_entity","molecular_entity",
#    and "genetic entity".  There's nothing wrong with them from a modeling standpoint, but for robokop, they're clutter.
#    This happens at the leaf side as well: biolink model contains separate classes for drug, metabolite, etc, but
#    we don't want them.
# 2. Adding multiple descent constraints.   We want to assert that every gene product is also a chemical_substance.
#    Biolink-model does not have any such relationship asserted, and is in fact, a tree, making it difficult to do
#    so, if you also want to keep the relationship to gene_or_gene_product.
